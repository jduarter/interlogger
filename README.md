### Implementation example

```
import { addPlugin as flipperPlugin } from 'react-native-flipper';

import {
  initMainScopeLogger,
  FlipperConsumer,
  ConsoleConsumer,
} from 'interlogger';

import type { Consumer } from 'interlogger';

const LOG_CONSUMERS: Consumer[] = [
  ConsoleConsumer,
  FlipperConsumer({
    flipperPlugin,
  }),
];

export const initLoggers = (): void => {
  initMainScopeLogger({
    consumers: LOG_CONSUMERS,
    rules: ({ doesNotMatch }) => ({
      any: [
        {
          all: [
          /* Log if:
           *   consumer.name != 'Flipper' &&
           *   scope != 'useGeneratorQueue'
           */
            doesNotMatch('$.consumer.name', 'Flipper'),
            doesNotMatch('$.scope', 'useGeneratorQueue'),
          ],
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
